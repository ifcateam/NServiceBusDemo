## Prerequisites

Ensure an instance of RabbitMQ is running and accessible.

This sample shows basic usage of RabbitMQ as a transport for NServiceBus. The application sends an empty message to itself, via the RabbitMQ broker, and writes to the console when the message is received.


### Configuration

snippet: ConfigureRabbit

The username and password can be configured via the connection string. If these are not present, the connection string defaults to `host=localhost;username=guest;password=guest`.
